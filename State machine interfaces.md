# State Machine Interfaces and Implementations  

## Core Idea  
The **state machine config** acts as an **interface**, defining the contract for other parts of the system to interact with it. Any **running actor** based on this config is an implementation, providing a way to retrieve the interface and understand what can be done with it.

## Key Questions  
1. **How do interfaces work together in a system?**  
   - The state machine config defines available states and transitions.  
   - The implementation (actor) executes those transitions and side effects.  

2. **How do we differentiate between what a state config describes and what actually happens within it?**  
   - The config provides structure: states, events, guards, and actions.  
   - The implementation determines execution: invoking effects, triggering events, and handling actor messages.  

3. **How do we handle side effects and actions while keeping the interface clean?**  
   - Effects and actions should be modular and type-safe.  
   - They should be describable without tying them into recursive type definitions.  

## Handling Recursive Type Definitions  
- The key challenge is describing an **interface for types** without making it **self-referential** in a way that causes infinite recursion.  
- **Breaking down the types** into discrete, non-recursive components allows for a clearer, structured definition of the system.  
- Potential solution:  
  - Define types for **state configs** separately from types for **actors**.  
  - Use **lookup tables** or **mappings** instead of direct references to avoid recursion.  

## Next Steps  
- [ ] Explore strategies for breaking down type interfaces.  
- [ ] Look into existing solutions in TypeScript for recursive type handling.  
- [ ] Consider how these interfaces interact dynamically at runtime.
