# Obsidian Gold: Thought Tracking and Knowledge Graph  

## Concept  
A tool that seamlessly captures **daily thoughts** in **Obsidian**, tagging them, linking them into topics, and generating a **coherent daily feed**. The system would:  
- **Store thoughts as Obsidian notes** in a structured way.  
- **Allow tagging and linking** for better knowledge management.  
- **Track daily progress on issues**, similar to GitHub Issues.  
- **Generate a daily feed** based on trending topics in your repository.  
- **Provide a lightweight time-tracking approach** (quarter-day, half-day increments).  

## Features  
1. **Daily Standup Log**  
   - Logs what you worked on.  
   - Summarizes key topics and trends from your notes.  
   - Provides an overview of ongoing work.  

2. **Knowledge Graph Integration**  
   - Auto-links related ideas.  
   - Highlights trending topics based on recent notes.  
   - Suggests next steps or missing connections.  

3. **Issue Tracking & GitHub Integration**  
   - Notes tied to **GitHub Issues**, tracking what was done each day.  
   - Helps document progress naturally.  

4. **Time Logging Without Hours**  
   - Tracks work in chunks (e.g., quarter-day, half-day).  
   - Encourages reflection without strict hour tracking.  

5. **Widget System for Standup & Tracking**  
   - Custom widgets inside a **streaming app** to view progress.  
   - Real-time insights on **what’s trending in your repository**.  

## Open Questions  
- How do we **visualize** these insights effectively?  
- What’s the best way to **sync notes with GitHub Issues**?  
- How can **widgets** be integrated into existing workflows?  

## Next Steps  
- [ ] Prototype a **note-to-feed pipeline** in Obsidian.  
- [ ] Explore GitHub API for issue tracking integration.  
- [ ] Design basic UI for knowledge graph insights.  
- [ ] Investigate existing tools that provide similar functionality.
