# Streaming components geekbook

## Requirements

- Load streaming components reliant on a lazy actor available loadable in geekbook without a streaming page context
- Components will have some deps to load, which can be added to an array
- Set the initial state of machines. How to do this without using the broadcast info?
- Question: Should the selected deps of a machine be loaded as well or do we update them with events
- Expose the machine events to the user. Probably some control panel
- What should the end component props and requirements be?
- Geekbook context different from streaming context. We currently point to the root actor
  - React context would not work as well as we still want to grab the state from the broadcast info without using a hook
