# The Evolution of AI and Human Roles  

## Current AI Capabilities  
AI is becoming highly proficient at:  
- **Short, context-free tasks** (e.g., answering simple questions, looking things up).  
- **Small, well-defined functions** (e.g., generating scripts, processing limited inputs).  
- **Basic system design** (e.g., automating workflows, simple integrations).  

## The Human Role in System Design  
Humans remain essential for:  
- **Stitching entire systems together**, ensuring coherence and long-term maintainability.  
- **Managing AI resources** and directing them toward efficient problem-solving.  
- **Building better tools** that allow AI to construct more complex systems.  

## The Next Evolution: AI as a Product Builder  
As AI improves, it will begin:  
- Constructing **larger systems from scratch**, reducing human involvement in technical details.  
- Enabling **rapid personal product development**, allowing individuals to build solutions tailored to their problems.  
- Taking over more **low-level system management tasks**, letting humans focus on high-level goals.  

## Example: AI-Powered Mac Automation  
- Imagine an AI-driven automation layer like **M3** with deep macOS integration.  
- Users could create custom scripts to:  
  - Control window positions dynamically.  
  - Remap keyboard keys instantly.  
  - Automate workflows based on system events.  

This kind of AI-augmented system would empower users to **build, refine, and manage their digital environments seamlessly**.  

## Next Steps  
- [ ] Explore AI-driven workflow automation tools.  
- [ ] Investigate permission models for system-level AI control.  
- [ ] Consider the ethical and security implications of AI-managed OS controls.
