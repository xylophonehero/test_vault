# TypeScript Caching Tool for Machine File Types

## Problem
We've observed significant slowness in TypeScript's internal compilations, specifically when accessing types and definitions from complex state machine files (`*.machine.ts`). With the number of machines likely increasing, it's essential to investigate and address these performance issues early.

## Objective
Create a TypeScript caching tool to reduce compilation overhead, specifically targeting state machine file types.

## Approach
- Develop a caching mechanism (tentatively named **TypeGem**) that automatically generates optimized type definitions whenever a `*.machine.ts` file is saved.
- Generated **TypeGem** files will serve as cached type definitions for state machines, significantly reducing repetitive workload on the TypeScript compiler.

## Steps to Implementation
1. **TS Performance Profiling**
   - Use **TS Server logs** to profile and identify bottlenecks in current type resolution and autocompletion times.
   - Establish baseline performance metrics for comparison.

2. **TypeGem File Generation**
   - Implement a script that triggers on save of any `*.machine.ts` file.
   - Automatically generate a corresponding cached type definition file (`*.machine.typegem.ts`).

3. **Integration**
   - Modify IDE tooling or TypeScript configuration to prioritize the cached type definitions.
   - Verify improvement through TS logs, focusing on autocompletion and definition lookup performance.

4. **Validation**
   - Benchmark before-and-after performance using TS Server logs.
   - Ensure no loss in developer experience (autocompletion accuracy, navigation, etc.).

## Next Steps
- [ ] Implement initial prototype of the TypeGem caching script.
- [ ] Profile and benchmark using TS Server logs.
- [ ] Document performance gains and evaluate broader application across the codebase.
